# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This is our first homework assignment for Boot Camp. One important rule to follow is:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.


## User Story

```

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria
